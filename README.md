#WiFiDar_FPGA - FPGA portion of the WiFiDar system

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS BY NO MEANS COMPLETE

This repository contains the code used on the FPGA side of the WiFiDar project.

I'm trying something new with this project, using git and my server to build 
with each commit. Since this is still something I'm testing I'm trying to push
it a fair bit, so you may notice quite a few commits to this repo (particularly 
small potentially meaningless ones).
